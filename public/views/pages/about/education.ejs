    <h1>University</h1>
    <p>Monash University - Clayton</p>
    <p>Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Commerce</p>

    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <div style='text-align:left;'>
      <p>A computer science degree spends a lot of time understanding the functional correctness and theoretical performance of algorithms, data structures and the physical operations of hardware. Whilst a software engineering degree also covers these areas, there is more emphasis on developing skills that aid software development in a professional environment. These skills include architectural planning, requirement solicitation, project management, assessing the compatibility of new components in a system and integration testing amongst others.</p>

      <p style='margin-bottom:0px;'>Notable software engineering university projects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Student Portal:
          <ul>
            <li>The task was to develop a student portal in a team of 27 students over the span of a full year using SAFe Methodologies and full stack development.</li>
            <li>I was integral in architectural planning and project management of this system.</li>
            <li>I built, tested and maintained a Python (Flask) RESTful API server which securely connected to an SQL database hosted on AWS, performed retrieval operations and returned data in JSON format.</li>
            <li>In the front-end, I developed REACT components that fetch data from the API server and dynamically update the display of the single page application.</li>
            <li>As expected, there were many project management challenges throughout this project. Communication skills are very important in a group of this size, so communication pipelines needed to be implemented. Also, project decisions were only handled by smaller specialty groups to prevent ‘decision by committee’ issues that would slow down the development process. My project management skills improved immensely throughout this project.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Healthcare application:
          <ul>
            <li>The task was for a two-person team to develop a Java application which allows healthcare workers to view healthcare data of their clients using FHIR RESTful API’s.</li>
            <li>It was important to maintain data security and user privileges as this application was accessing critical data.</li>
            <li>Minimizing calls to the API server was essential as it allowed the application to run quickly.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Econometrics</h2>
    <div style='text-align:left;'>
      <p>Econometrics combines economics with business analytics. In doing so, econometricians need to study traditional micro- and macro-economics as well as data analysis techniques. This allows econometricians to clean raw data, analyse trends in the cleaned data, prove or disprove economic theories associated with the data or propose new theories.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <div style='text-align:left;'>
      <p>Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that can model a system once trained on a large dataset. This area of data analysis utilises both my econometrics and software engineering skills.</p>

      <p style='margin-bottom:0px;'>Notable software engineering university projects include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Predicting hourly electricity demand within multiple co-dependent and independent regions in America using artificial neural networks:
          <ul>
            <li>In a team of 4, we were given hourly electricity demand for 20 electricity grids in America over a 10-year window. Some of these grids have capped interconnectors between them (similar to the Australian NEM) and others are completely isolated.</li>
            <li>Our task was to predict the electricity demand in each region multiple hours into the future using lags of previous hours’ electricity usage and knowledge of annual trends.</li>
            <li>We found that our neural network could accurately interpret annual trends. However, the hourly demand was difficult to predict without weather data.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Predicting the outcome of each tennis point in the Australian Open:
          <ul>
            <li>In a team of 4 students using R, we were given data on every shot from 2017-19 Australian Opens. This data included each players position, the position of each shot, the height of each shot above the net, the speed of each shot and an identifier for the point being played. We were tasked to predict whether each point ended with a ‘winning shot’, a ‘forced error’ or an ‘unforced error’.</li>
            <li>Machine learning algorithms considered were random forests, neural networks, support vector machines and k-means clustering. The best model was using the XGBoost module in R (boosted, gradient decision trees). We achieved a performance of 95%.</li>
